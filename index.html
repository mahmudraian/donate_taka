    <H1 class="bonusNote">Their lives depend on your donation
    </H1>
    <P class="bonusNote">The extreme flooding has caused heartbreaking damage across north-eastern Bangladesh putting 1.6 million children at risk. UNICEF is working with government and local partners to provide emergency supplies and services to those affected by floods. Children are in need, crowded in shelters for multiple days and facing a high risk of drowning. Over 90% of the health facilities in the region have been inundated, leaving childrens without health care, while cases of waterborne diseases continue to rise. Your donation will help support children in Bangladesh during this emergency, to help them survive, and to help rebuild after the floods. They need help now.</P>
